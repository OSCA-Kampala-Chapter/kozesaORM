# kozesaORM
A python based Object Relational Mapper to help you speed up application development
by abstracting away the fairly complex SQL nitty-gritties and providing you an easy-to-use interface 
to interact with your relational database.

kozesaORM aims to be fairly lightweight but really powerful and intuitive to use. with less python code,
you can achieve really powerful queries. The code architecture is based off an event-driven non-blocking pattern
to keep your application responsive as queries run in the background
